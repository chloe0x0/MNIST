An MNIST Digit Classifier as an introduction to the Pytorch framework

## Model Architecture

Currently using a small, basic Feed-forward Multilayer perceptron. Obviously a CNN would be better, may write one later... 

Consequently It can train on CPU without taking an eternity.

## TODO

* Data Augmentation with transforms (better accuracy)
* Write a Convolutional Neural Network (also better accuracy)
* Learn argparse (seems to be pretty widley used)
